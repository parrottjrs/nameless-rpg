This is a WIP that is going to be put together in my spare time, based on a tutorial by Chris Courses on Youtube.  

The main concept I've learned about while working on this is map theory, but i have also used this to solidify my understanding of the basics of HTML5 canvas. 

## Tools I've used so far:

- Sprite sheets and tilesets from [itch.io](https://itch.io)
- Tiled Map Editor
- HTML5 Canvas
- Javascript

### Here's what the map looks like so far. It was exported with a handful of layers to allow for things such as collisions and foreground images.
